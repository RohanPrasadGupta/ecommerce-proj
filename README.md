Project Brief
I recently developed a comprehensive e-commerce platform with a modern tech stack and robust features. This project demonstrates my ability to create complex web applications with attention to both functionality and user experience.

Key Technologies Used:

Frontend
Next.js: Built with the latest Next.js features for server and client components
Redux: Implemented for global state management (cart, selected items, user preferences)
TanStack Query (React Query): Used for efficient data fetching, caching, and state synchronization
Material UI & Tailwind CSS: Combined for responsive, elegant UI components with custom styling
Framer Motion: Added subtle animations for enhanced user experience
Axios: Handled API requests with interceptors for authentication
React Hot Toast: Implemented for user-friendly notifications

Backend Integration
RESTful API: Connected to backend services for product, user, cart and order management
Authentication System: JWT-based authentication with secure storage
Real-time Data Synchronization: Implemented optimistic updates for cart operations
MongoDB: Store all data

Features
Dynamic Product Search: Real-time filtering and sorting
Advanced Filtering: By category, price range, rating, availability
Comprehensive Product Details: With specifications, reviews, ratings
Inventory Management: Real-time stock tracking and availability display
Cart Management: Add, remove, update quantities with optimistic UI updates
